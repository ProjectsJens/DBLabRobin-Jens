We all know the discussion what movie should I watch today? When you watch television, we see a lot of advertising about ”good” movies, but sometimes there are just bad or mainstream trash. 
Our goal is to search for insider tipps in the movie industry. 
That means we want to research movies, which doesnt have the money to do publicity as much as hollywood productions. 
We are searching for insider movies, which doesnt have so much specialeﬀects as the mainstream movies and we want to help independent studios which doesnt have the money to do advertising as hollywood productions but produce good movies.
We use the Movie Data set on the Kagglewebpage. It is our metadata and has over 45,000 movies. 
There are 26 million ratings from over 270,000 users. The last update was two months ago. 
In our project we are streaming the movies in chronological order day for day in the pipeline. 
Every month we refresh our cluster and build a new static model for analyze it.
